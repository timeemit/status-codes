3xx Class -- The client must take additional action to complete the request. Many of these status codes are used in URL redirection.  A user agent may carry out additional action with no user interaction only if the method used in the second request is GET or HEAD. A user agent should not automatically redirect a request more than five times, since such redirections usually indicate an infinite loop.
